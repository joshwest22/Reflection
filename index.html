<h2 id="leftHead"> Hardest Thing I've Learned</h1>
    <p>The hardest thing that I have learned so far was when and how to use the .map() feature. I also struggled to grasp how it worked, but eventually after enough attempts and help from Dr. Bradshaw I was able to realize that .map should be used in any scenario in which you want to transform an array of one type of data (e.g. numbers, objects, strings, etc.) into an array of another type. Once you understand the context in which it is used, the syntax is no problem as it is: <pre>originalArray.map(newArrayTransformationFcn+5)</pre> Where everything inside of the parantheses represents a function that transforms your original data into the desired data in the new array.</p>

<h2 id="rightHead"> My Biggest Misunderstanding</h1>
    <p>My biggest current misunderstanding is the core d3 algorithm. I am still getting it completely memorized and I know when to use it, but I don't completely unsertand the nuance of what each step does. I am confused about how things are selected vs how they are created an appended. Specifically, this means I am confused about the difference in function between .select(), .selectAll(), and .append(). I beleive that select chooses the existing element and then append puts a new kind of DOM element after/inside the selected element. So is selectAll() only used in the process of binding data to unformed elements?</p>
